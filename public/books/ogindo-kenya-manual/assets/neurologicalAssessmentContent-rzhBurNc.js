Alert**: Patient is awake, oriented, responds appropriately to questions","  - Opens eyes spontaneously, follows commands, normal conversation","  - Oriented to person, place, time, and situation","• **V - Voice**: Patient responds to verbal stimuli","  - Opens eyes or moves in response to loud voice","  - May be confused but shows response to verbal commands","• **P - Pain**: Patient responds only to painful stimuli","  - No response to voice but reacts to physical pain","  - Central pain: trapezius squeeze, sternum rub","  - Peripheral pain: nail bed pressure, ear lobe pinch","• **U - Unresponsive**: No response to any stimuli","  - No eye opening, no verbal response, no motor response","  - Requires immediate advanced assessment and intervention","","🚨 **Clinical Significance**:","• **Alert**: Normal consciousness, routine monitoring","• **Voice/Pain**: Altered consciousness -
